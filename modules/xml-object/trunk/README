XML::Object 
===========

DESCRIPTION

This library provides a simple wrapper around an XML document,
enabling access to the document as if it was a native Perl
object. It provides an excellent way to quickly integrate ad-hoc
querying and manipulation of XML fragments under Perl, without needing
to write custom parsers, etc. Features include:

* Object Orientated API
* Optional Tied Hash API
* Namespace Support 
* Support for creation/handling of XML::Object fragments
* Auto vivify node paths
* Directly alters the underlying input XML document

Given that the library provides direct access to the underlying XML
document (without parsing it into some itermediate state), it is best
suited for situations where only limited querying or maniplulation is
required. If large documents need to be handled or intensive
read/write access to the document is required, then you are probably
better off using either SAX or something like XML::Simple.

STATUS

XML::Object should be considered alpha quality software and lacks
extensive testing on a wide variety of platforms.

XML::XSP
========

DESCRIPTION

XML::XSP implements a Perl based eXtensibe Server Page (XSP)
processor, a server side technology tailored to dynamically generating
XML documents though the use of embeding code (similar to ASP or
JSP). XML::XSP employs a transform model to evaluate the XSP page,
enabling precompiled XSP Page transformers, to be cached and used upon
any source document of the same form. Key advantages derived from this
model include:

* Higher performance when evaluating documents containing only a few
  XSP tag.

* Source documents that have differing content, but the same XSP tags
  can all use the same precompiled XSP Page transformer. 

However this method does have the memory/performance overhead of
requiring a DOM to be built, though given that XSP is usually used in
conjuction with an XSLT processor (which also requires a DOM) to apply
the presentation layer, the impact is minimal.

The XSP processor can also be extended through the use of user defined
Taglibs. These can be deployed to create additional XSP tags that can
be embeded within a document and control how they are evaluated.

Further general information about XSP is available from:

STATUS

XML::XSP can be considered alpha quality software, since while has
been tested and deployed in live environments, it still lacks
extensive testing on a wide variety of platforms.

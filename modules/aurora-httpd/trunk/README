Aurora::HTTPD
=============

DESCRIPTION

Aurora::HTTPD is a pure perl, lightweight HTTPD for Aurora, built upon
the POE Component Framework. It is designed primarily to be used in a
development environment or internally within an organisation, where
the deployment of a full blown webserver (such as Apache) isn't
justified. Under no circumstances should this server be deployed in a
hostile environment, since little serious thought has been given to
the servers security model. 

The HTTPD currently supports:

* Virtual Hosts
* Access and Error logging

Further information about Aurora can be found at:

STATUS

Aurora::HTTPD should be considered as alpha quality software and has
not been tested extensively.

2004|04|09 Bug fixes
2002|03|09 First public release of Aurora::HTTPD

Currently, the Aurora::HTTPD doesn't support:

* PUT Requests
* Multipart POST Requests

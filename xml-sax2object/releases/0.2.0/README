XML::SAX2Object
===============

DESCRIPTION

XML::SAX2Object is Perl library for building Perl datastructures from 
SAX2 events and vice versa (i.e generating SAX2 events based upon
datastructure). Key features include:

  * Completely SAX2 based (includes a SAX2 Builder and Generator)
  * Full Namespace support
  * Configurable processing
  * Analyses the XML document for node names that are the plural of a
    child's and representing them automatically as lists (even if there
    is only one child).

STATUS


XML::SAX2Object can be considered beta quality software, that while
it has been tested and deployed in live environments, it still lacks
extensive testing on a wide variety of platforms.

2004|04|03  Improved namespace support and bug fixes.

2002|02|26  Fixed bugs in namespace handling and added a
	    NamespaceIgnore option, which will cause all elements with
	    namespaces not declared in the namespace map to be ignored.

2002|02|19  First public release of XML::SAX2Object

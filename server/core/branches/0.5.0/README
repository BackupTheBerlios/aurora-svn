Aurora
======

DESCRIPTION

Aurora is a XML based content delivery system, providing a general
framework with which content can be dynamically repurposed. It is
particularly well suited for dealing with sites that need to process

Aurora can either be used directly from within a Perl or embeded into
3rd party applications such as Apache/mod_perl & Zeus webserver.

* XML Sitemaps

Built in support for server configuration via XML.

* Modular

The framework is completely modular, enabling it to easily be
customised and extended.

* Pipelines

The framework has build in support for XML pipelines, providing an
easy mechanism to process and repurpose data.

* Sessions & Connection Pools

Aurora has built in support for session and connection pools.

* Caching

There is advanced caching support, enabling fine grained control over
what data to cache, including partly processed responses.
